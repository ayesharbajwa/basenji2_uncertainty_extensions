# basenji2_uncertainty_extensions

The two analysis notebooks here build on [previous work](https://github.com/ni-lab/basenji2_uncertainty) to analyze uncertainty in predictions of an ensemble of Basenji2 models.

The first extension is uncertainty quantification based on [conformal prediction](https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal-prediction/tree/main), using the scalar method adapted from [here](https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal-prediction/blob/main/notebooks/meps-uncertainty-scalar.ipynb).

The second extension is motif analysis based on [tfmodisco-lite](https://github.com/jmschrei/tfmodisco-lite).
